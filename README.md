simplegui-wrapper
=================

SimpleGUI is the graphics module for CodeSkulptor, a Python IDE developed by Scott Rixner of Rice University for the 
course "Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python," which is offered both at Rice University and online through
Coursera. Unlike most Python IDEs, CodeSkulptor runs only in a browser. The Python subset run by CodeSkulptor is 
implemented on top of JavaScript. 

SimpleGUI-Wrapper is my attempt to build a wrapper that will allow a regular Python interpreter to run programs that use
SimpleGUI. To use SimpleGUI-Wrapper, simplegui.py must be in a location where it can be imported by your SimpleGUI
program. Currently, Python 3 is not supported.
